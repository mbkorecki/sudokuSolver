A sudoku solver written in Haskell. The solver solves the sudoku or if it is not correct returns an error message. An incorrect sudoku has no answers or more than one answer. 

To use the solver compile the sudokuSolver.hs file like this:  
$ghc sudokuSolver.hs  

To use the solver:  
$sudokuSolver < input.txt       

The input file should be a text file with each line representing a line of the sudoku with 0 denoting the empty fields. Thus a proper input has 9 lines of 9 digits without any spaces. Examples of input files can be found in the examples folder. The examples 1 and 3 are correct and should yield a solution, while examples 2 and 4 are incorrect and should yield the following message: "The sudoku is incorrect (no solutions or more than one solution)."
